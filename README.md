# Demo
This repo will includes a demo showcasing the functionality of ZK Auditor with a frontend interface. The demo will allow users to simulate the detection of vulnerabilities and the generation of ZKPs. Users can interact with the frontend to initiate audit sessions, view generated ZKPs, and explore the audit trail.
