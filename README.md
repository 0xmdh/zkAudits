# zkAudits
zkAudits is a tool designed to improve the integrity of security audit processes between auditors and client companies. The tool uses ZK to enable auditors to demonstrate the existence of vulnerabilities in a client's network without disclosing sensitive details about those vulnerabilities.
# Features
- `ZKP Generation`: The tool facilitates the generation of cryptographic proofs using ZKPs to attest to the existence of vulnerabilities without revealing specific details.
- `Secure Storage`: Generated ZKPs are securely stored in a tamper-proof environment, ensuring confidentiality and integrity.
- `Access Control`: Access to ZKPs is strictly controlled, with only authorized personnel within the auditing company granted permission to view or interact with the proofs.
- `Monitoring`: The tool includes monitoring mechanisms to detect and alert on any unauthorized attempts to access the ZKPs.
- `Audit Trail`: All interactions with the ZKPs are logged in an immutable audit trail, providing a comprehensive record of access.
- `Revocation Mechanism`: In case of suspected breaches, there is a mechanism to revoke access to ZKPs or invalidate them to prevent further misuse.
# Optional Features
- `API Integration`: The tool can be extended to function as an API service, allowing for integration with other security tools or platforms.

# Demo
This repo will includes a demo showcasing the functionality of ZK Auditor with a frontend interface. The demo will allow users to simulate the detection of vulnerabilities and the generation of ZKPs. Users can interact with the frontend to initiate audit sessions, view generated ZKPs, and explore the audit trail.
